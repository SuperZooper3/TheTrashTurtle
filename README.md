Welcome to the beach! You're **The Trash Turtle**, a mother cleaning up trash from the beach so her newborn babies can safely hatch and make the treck to the ocean.

Your goal is to **pick up the most peices of trash** possible, becasue with more trash picked up, more babies will hatch and make it to the ocean!

We fit the theme by making the trash bag on your back get bigger and bigger as you pick up more trash, and the more trash the more babies hatch! So a **bigger** trash bag, means a **better** ending!
